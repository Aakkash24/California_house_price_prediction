# California_house_price_prediction
This is a Regression problem which predicts the house price in California

The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:

1.longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west

2. latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north

3. housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building

4. totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block

5. totalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block

6. population: Total number of people residing within a block

7. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block

8. medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)

9. medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)

10. oceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

Here the independent fields are longitude,latitude,housingmedianage,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income and ocean_proximity and the dependent field(target) is medianhousevalue
