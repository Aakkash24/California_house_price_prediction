# California_house_price_prediction
This is a Regression problem which predicts the house price in California

The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:

longitude

latitude

housingmedianage

total_rooms

total_bedrooms

population

households

median_income

medianhousevalue

ocean_proximity


Here the independent fields are longitude,latitude,housingmedianage,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income and ocean_proximity and the dependent field(target) is medianhousevalue
